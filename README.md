# convertingMathProjects
Converting my projects from my mathematical courses from Matlab to Python, Java, and other modern languages.


Singular Value Transformation\n
File: svt.py\n
Status: Incomplete\n
Description: 
  In Matlab, I wrote an algorithm that was explained in a scientific paper using pseudocode and specific boundary conditions.  The program recovers a low-rank matrix M from a subset of sampled entries, it was used to recreate experimental results. I am converting it into Python.
